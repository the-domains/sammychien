# voice for BLM movement

I can't sleep, I've been reading/researching on the BLM movement, news and incidents, as well as people's reactions and comments around the world. It's really disturbing and disheartening, yet very inspiring at the same time. 

I want to scream out so loudly so everyone can hear it, like the BLM protesters are doing fundamentally, BLM not only matters to black people, but all human being. Everything is connected, if there's something wrong with our social system, it affects everyone living in that system, just some surface more severely than others. Some gets more privileges and benefits than other, but in the end, everything will have to return to a balance, so don't think that because you're not in immediate trouble and pain in this moment, it doesn't affect you in the future, we ALL have to pay for the price.   
I know this very well because every time I post about racism issues, sexism issues, inequality issues, there will be the same privilege and ignorant perspective and comments that comes up, the world hasn't change enough for us to move on from the problems carried over from generations and of our history. 

When a POC talk about racism, they're blamed for making divisions, or causing problems that doesn't exist, or be patronized or silenced. When women screams for equality, raises feminism, privilege men starts bitching or tries to brush it off, or wants to talk about men's rights before even truly listening to the issues; White fragility and privilege is still a very prominent issue, you can see it surfacing and triggering by the BLM movement, it's a very difficult time to educate ignorance, but it is also a very important time to. Fingers are not pointing at you if you're not part of the problem, if you're not that ignorant mass, if you're an ally that understands humanism and have impetus and intention for positive change. 

I was part of a big social movement once. I've witness clearly how the media really controls/distort people's ideology about the reality. It is controlled by the people in power who's benefits are in threat by people waking up to the long due problems. Believers and activists, please stay strong. It's a global awareness, a global issue, a global voice for humanity. 

I'm an Asian-Canadian/ person of colour/ queer /activist artist, or as simple as-- a human who cares about humanity at large. I will stay conscious, cautious, critical and clear about these global issues. We can all help speed up the process by sharing our voices in a intelligent, civilized, diplomatic way, and really ask yourself in your heart, with fullest empathy and compassion. Less innocent souls will have to suffer for our ignorance and mistakes.
