Had a really good meeting with scientist Samuel Brenner who I will be collaborating with at Science World! We chat about our research, natural environment and convey our experiments in a fun way. I found it really interesting how Samuel uses body movement while delineating his research on fluid mechanics about the effects of wind on lakes. Maybe we will all start dancing in science world with the kids being the water in the lake.
