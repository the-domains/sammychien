  Had a really good meeting with scientist Samuel Brenner who I will be
  collaborating with at Science World! We chat about our research, natural
  environment and convey our experiments in a fun way. I found it really
  interesting how Samuel uses body movement while delineating his research on
  fluid mechanics about the effects of wind on lakes. Maybe we will all start
  dancing in science world with the kids being the water in the lake.
